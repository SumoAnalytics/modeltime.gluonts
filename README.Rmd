> Deep Learning for Time Series, simplified. 

__Important: This package is being maintained on GitHub (not CRAN). Please install the `development version`, which is updated with the latest features:__

```
# Install Development Version 
remotes::install_github("business-science/modeltime.gluonts")
```

Modeltime GluonTS integrates the __Python GluonTS Deep Learning Library__, making it easy to develop forecasts using Deep Learning for those that are comfortable with the [Modeltime Forecasting Workflow](https://business-science.github.io/modeltime/). 

```{r, echo=F}
knitr::include_graphics("man/figures/m4_hourly_forecast.jpg")
```


## GluonTS in R

Using `deep_ar()`, which connects to `GluonTS DeepAREstimator()`.

```{r example, eval = F}
library(modeltime.gluonts)
library(tidymodels)
library(tidyverse)

# Fit a GluonTS DeepAR Model
model_fit_deepar <- deep_ar(
    id                    = "id",
    freq                  = "M",
    prediction_length     = 24,
    lookback_length       = 48,
    epochs                = 5
) %>%
    set_engine("gluonts_deepar") %>%
    fit(value ~ ., training(m750_splits))

# Forecast with 95% Confidence Interval
modeltime_table(
    model_fit_deepar
) %>%
    modeltime_calibrate(new_data = testing(m750_splits)) %>%
    modeltime_forecast(
        new_data      = testing(m750_splits),
        actual_data   = m750,
        conf_interval = 0.95
    ) %>%
    plot_modeltime_forecast(.interactive = FALSE)
```

```{r, echo = F}
knitr::include_graphics("man/figures/deepar_example_1.png")
```


## Installation

There are 2 key components to installing Modeltime GluonTS:

1. Download the R-Package, `modeltime.gluonts`. This installs the R-Bindings, which allows you to interface with GluonTS. 

2. Set up the Python Environment so `modeltime.gluonts` can connect to the `gluonts` python package. 

### Step 1 - Download & Install Modeltime GluonTS

Download the latest development version.  

``` r
remotes::install_github("business-science/modeltime.gluonts")
```

### Step 2 - Python Environment Setup

Next, you'll need to set up a Python Environment that contains at a minimum: 

- `gluonts==0.8.0`
- `mxnet`
- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `pathlib`

The python environment then needs to be activated with `reticulate`.

__Fast GluonTS Setup__

You can use `install_gluonts()` to prepare and bind to a python environment containing `gluonts` and the required python packages. 

- You only need to run this one time, and then you are good to go. 
- Each time you load `modeltime.gluonts`, the package will include this environment in it's search process. 


```{r, eval=F}
# GluonTS Installation - Run 1st time
install_gluonts()
```

### Step 3 - Restart R and Try an Example

Restart your R session (if in RStudio, close and re-open). Then try this example. 

```{r, eval=F}
library(modeltime.gluonts)
library(tidymodels)
library(tidyverse)

# Fit a GluonTS DeepAR Model
model_fit_deepar <- deep_ar(
    id                    = "id",
    freq                  = "M",
    prediction_length     = 24,
    lookback_length       = 48,
    epochs                = 5
) %>%
    set_engine("gluonts_deepar") %>%
    fit(value ~ ., training(m750_splits))

# Forecast with 95% Confidence Interval
modeltime_table(
    model_fit_deepar
) %>%
    modeltime_calibrate(new_data = testing(m750_splits)) %>%
    modeltime_forecast(
        new_data      = testing(m750_splits),
        actual_data   = m750,
        conf_interval = 0.95
    ) %>%
    plot_modeltime_forecast(.interactive = FALSE)
```


## Troubleshooting Installation

Python Environment setup is always fun. Here are a few recommendations if you run into an issue.

- __Check to make sure Conda or Miniconda is available__ using `reticulate::conda_version()`. If no conda version is returned, then use `reticulate::install_miniconda()` to install Miniconda (recommended vs full Aniconda). Then (re-)run `install_gluonts()`. 

- __Check if GluonTS (Python) is available__ using `reticulate::py_module_available("gluonts")`. If this returns `TRUE`, then your installation has succeeded in building the environment, but you may have other issues like missing C++ build tools (next).

- __Windows 10 error: Microsoft Visual C++ is required.__ [Here are the instructions for installing the C++ tools needed.](https://github.com/business-science/modeltime.gluonts/issues/4) 

- __Other installation issues.__ [Please file a GitHub issue here.](https://github.com/business-science/modeltime.gluonts/issues)

### Time Series is Changing

Time series is changing. __Businesses now need 10,000+ time series forecasts every day.__ This is what I call a _High-Performance Time Series Forecasting System (HPTSF)_ - Accurate, Robust, and Scalable Forecasting. 

 __High-Performance Forecasting Systems will save companies by improving accuracy and scalability.__ Imagine what will happen to your career if you can provide your organization a "High-Performance Time Series Forecasting System" (HPTSF System).

### How to Learn High-Performance Time Series Forecasting

I teach how to build a HPTFS System in my [__High-Performance Time Series Forecasting Course__](https://university.business-science.io/p/ds4b-203-r-high-performance-time-series-forecasting). You will learn:
