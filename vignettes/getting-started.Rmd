## Making an N-Beats Ensemble

Let's get started by making an __N-BEATS ENSEMBLE.__ N-BEATS is a powerful algorithm that has shown [exceptional results^1^](#references).  In a matter of minutes, you'll generate the 4 forecasts shown below. If you'd like to improve your time series forecasting abilities, then please take my [High-Performance Time Series Course](https://university.business-science.io/p/ds4b-203-r-high-performance-time-series-forecasting/). 

```{r, echo=F}
library(tidyverse)
library(modeltime)
library(modeltime.gluonts)

modeltime_forecast_tbl <- read_rds("modeltime_forecast_tbl.rds")

modeltime_forecast_tbl %>%
  plot_modeltime_forecast(
    .facet_ncol   = 2, 
    .facet_scales = "free",
    .interactive  = FALSE
  )
```


## Libraries

Load the following libraries. 

```{r setup}
library(modeltime.gluonts)
library(tidymodels)
library(tidyverse)
library(timetk)
```

## Installation

Next, set up the Python Environment with `install_gluonts()`. You only need to run this one time, and then you are good to go. 

```{r, eval=F}
install_gluonts()
```

### Troubleshooting Installation

Python Environment setup is always fun. Here are a few recommendations if you run into an issue.

- __Check to make sure Conda or Miniconda is available__ using `reticulate::conda_version()`. If no conda version is returned, then use `reticulate::install_miniconda()` to install. Then (re-)run `install_gluonts()`. 

- __Check if GluonTS (Python) is available__ using `reticulate::py_module_available("gluonts")`. If this returns `TRUE`, then your installation has succeeded in building the environment, but you may have other issues like missing C++ build tools (next).

- __Windows 10 error: Microsoft Visual C++ is required.__ [Here are the instructions for installing the C++ tools needed.](https://github.com/business-science/modeltime.gluonts/issues/4) 

- __Other installation issues.__ [Please file a GitHub issue here.](https://github.com/business-science/modeltime.gluonts/issues)

## Time Series Data

We'll use the `m4_hourly` dataset, which contains 4 hourly time series.

```{r}
data <- m4_hourly %>%
  select(id, date, value) %>%
  group_by(id) %>%
  mutate(value = standardize_vec(value)) %>%
  ungroup()

data
```

We'll create the forecast region using `future_frame()`. We are forecasting 1 week (24x7 timestamps) into the future.

```{r}
HORIZON <- 24*7

new_data <- data %>%
  group_by(id) %>%
  future_frame(.length_out = HORIZON) %>%
  ungroup()

new_data
```


## Making an N-Beats Ensemble Model

We'll create a model using the N-BEATS ENSEMBLE algorithm using the `nbeats()` function. 

- This is a univariate modeling algorithm that ensembles (combines) multiple N-BEATS Deep Learning models. 
- We select the Ensemble Version of N-BEATS by setting the engine to `gluonts_nbeats_ensemble`.
- The meta-learner uses 3 sub-models by adjusting the `lookback_length`. We can include more sub-models adjusting the `bagging_size`. 


```{r, eval = FALSE}
model_fit_nbeats_ensemble <- nbeats(
  id                    = "id",
  freq                  = "H",
  prediction_length     = HORIZON,
  lookback_length       = c(HORIZON, 4*HORIZON),
  epochs                = 5,
  num_batches_per_epoch = 15,
  batch_size            = 1 
) %>%
  set_engine("gluonts_nbeats_ensemble") %>%
  fit(value ~ date + id, data)
```


An NBEATS ENSEMBLE is produced. 

```{r, eval=F}
model_fit_nbeats_ensemble
```

```{r, echo=F}
knitr::include_graphics("nbeats_model.jpg")
```


## Forecasting 

With a model in hand, we can simply follow the [Modeltime Workflow](https://business-science.github.io/modeltime/) to generate a forecast for the multiple time series groups. 

```{r, eval=F}
modeltime_forecast_tbl <- modeltime_table(
  model_fit_nbeats_ensemble
) %>%
  modeltime_forecast(
    new_data    = new_data,
    actual_data = data,
    keep_data   = TRUE
  ) %>%
  group_by(id) 
```

We can visualize the forecast with `plot_modeltime_forecast()`.

```{r}
modeltime_forecast_tbl %>%
  plot_modeltime_forecast(
    .conf_interval_show = FALSE, 
    .facet_ncol         = 2, 
    .facet_scales       = "free",
    .interactive        = FALSE
  )
```


## Saving and Loading Models

GluonTS models will need to "serialized" (a fancy word for saved to a directory that contains the recipe for recreating the models). To save the models, use `save_gluonts_model()`.

- Provide a directory where you want to save the model. 
- This saves all of the model files in the directory.
- __Note that N-BEATS models can be VERY LARGE.__

```{r, eval = FALSE}
model_fit_nbeats_ensemble %>%
  save_gluonts_model(path = "nbeats_ensemble_model", overwrite = TRUE)
```


You can reload the model into R using `load_gluonts_model()`.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
model_fit_nbeats_ensemble <- load_gluonts_model("nbeats_ensemble_model")
```
